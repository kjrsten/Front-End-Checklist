# Front-End Checklist for WEBI 2023

The **Front-End Checklist** is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your site / HTML page to production.

It is based on Front-End developers' years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

Some elements from the original checklist have been removed to better align this list with the final project for Web Design Problems 1.

This checklist will be used to grade final projects.



## Table of Contents

1. **[Head](#head)**
2. **[HTML](#html)**
3. **[Webfonts](#webfonts)**
4. **[CSS](#css)**
5. **[Images](#images)**
6. **[JavaScript](#javascript)**
7. **[Performance](#performance)**
8. **[Accessibility](#accessibility)**
9. **[SEO](#seo)**

## How to use?

All items in the **Front-End Checklist** are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* ![Low][low_img] means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* ![Medium][medium_img] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* ![High][high_img] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* ðŸ“–: documentation or article
* ðŸ› : online tool / testing tool
* ðŸ“¹: media or video content

## Head

> **Notes:** You can find [a list of everything](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

### Meta tag

* [ ] **Doctype:** ![High][high_img] The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

```html
<!-- Doctype HTML5 -->
<!doctype html>
```

> * ðŸ“– [Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding)

*The next 3 meta tags (Charset, X-UA Compatible and Viewport) need to come first in the head.*

* [ ] **Charset:** ![High][high_img] The charset (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

* [ ] **X-UA-Compatible:** ![Medium][medium_img] The X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present.

```html
<!-- Instruct Internet Explorer to use its latest rendering engine -->
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
```

> * ðŸ“– [Specifying legacy document modes (Internet Explorer)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj676915(v=vs.85).aspx)

* [ ] **Viewport:** ![High][high_img] The viewport is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

* [ ] **Title:** ![High][high_img] A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculate the pixel width of the characters used in the title, cut off between 472 and 482 pixels. Average character limit would be around 55-characters).

```html
<!-- Document Title -->
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>
```

> * ðŸ“– [Title - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)
> * ðŸ›  [SERP Snippet Generator](https://www.sistrix.com/serp-snippet-generator/)

* [ ] **Description:** ![High][high_img] A meta description is provided, it is unique and doesn't possess more than 150 characters.

```html
<!-- Meta Description -->
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page less than 150 characters">
```

> * ðŸ“–[Meta Description - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#Adding_an_author_and_description)

* [ ] **Favicons:** ![Medium][medium_img] Each favicon has been created and displays correctly. If you have only a `favicon.ico`, put it at the root of your site. Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, **PNG format is recommended** over `.ico` format (dimensions: 32x32px).

```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico">
<!-- Recommended favicon format -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://example.com/favicon.png">
```

* [ ] **Apple Touch Icon:** ![Low][low_img] Apple touch favicon apple-mobile-web-app-capable are present *(Create your Apple Icon file with at least 200x200px dimension to support all dimensions that you may need).*

> * ðŸ“– [Configuring Web Applications](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html)

- [ ] **Windows Tiles:**![Low][low_img] Windows tiles are present and linked.

```html
<!-- Microsoft Tiles -->
<meta name="msapplication-config" content="browserconfig.xml" />
```

Minimum required xml markup for the browserconfig.xml file is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<browserconfig>
   <msapplication>
     <tile>
        <square70x70logo src="small.png"/>
        <square150x150logo src="medium.png"/>
        <wide310x150logo src="wide.png"/>
        <square310x310logo src="large.png"/>
     </tile>
   </msapplication>
</browserconfig>
```

### HTML tags

* [ ] **Language attribute:** ![High][high_img] The `lang` attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

```html
<html lang="en">
```




* [ ] **CSS order:** ![High][high_img] All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the `<head>`. NOTE: In almost all cases your JS files will be referenced at the bottom of the page, before the closing \<body\> tag.

### Social meta

***Facebook OG*** and ***Twitter Cards*** are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display.

* [ ] **Facebook Open Graph:** ![Low][low_img] All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with a false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, 1200 x 630 pixels recommended.

> **Notes:** Using `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it.

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page.html">
<meta property="og:title" content="Content Title">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Site Name">
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US">
<!-- Next tags are optional but recommended -->
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
```
